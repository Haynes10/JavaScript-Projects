# JavaScript Projects

These are small web development projects I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while learning the fundamentals of front-end development. Each project helped me practice different concepts like DOM manipulation, user input handling, styling, and logic building.

## üì¶ Projects

### üçï Pizza Menu
This is an interactive pizza ordering app. Users can select a pizza size, choose multiple meat and vegetable toppings, and place their order. The app calculates the total cost based on user selections and displays a receipt in real time. The final version includes background images and a unique UI to give it a professional, modern look.

### ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A browser-based version of the classic tic-tac-toe game. Two players can play against each other with customizable tokens. The game randomly rolls dice to decide which player goes first. When a player wins, a celebratory animation with music and lights is displayed.

### üßÆ Calculator
A basic calculator app that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and minimal design and is fully responsive for different screen sizes. Great for practicing JavaScript logic and UI layout.
